# Fizzbuzz
by Anne Ensign

See my thinking process through the "FizzBuzz" interview question!
Demo page: https://eleanor-shellstrop.github.io/fizzbuzz/

## Instructions:
1. Print a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100.
2. If a number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz."
3. If a number is a mutiple of 5, print "Buzz."
4. If a number is both a multiple of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"


* Commit made after each completed step for reader to easily see how I built out the function.
* Easy visualizations of results by linking a stylesheet to the index page.
